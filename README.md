This project analyses trends in box office performance with a focus on three key factors: genre, budget, and release dates. The goal is to identify patterns that influence movie success and to provide actionable insights for filmmakers, studios, and investors.
Problem Statement
The movie industry is highly competitive, with box office performance influenced by multiple variables. Understanding how genre, production budget, and release timing affect revenue is essential for making informed production and distribution decisions.
